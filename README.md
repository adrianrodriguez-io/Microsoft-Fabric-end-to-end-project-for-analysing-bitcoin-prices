Microsoft Fabric end to end project for analyzing Bitcoin prices

## Description
Demo about an end to end project developed with Microsoft Fabric. The aim of this project is to showcase my skills on using different Fabric workloads in order to ingest data from a Rest API endpoint that provides historical data about Bitcoin prices as well as data transformation using a notebook that runs on a spark cluster using pyspark, and after that populating some dimensions and a fact table following a star schema data model in a synapse datawarehouse that on top of that is built a power bi report for data visualization. The orchestration is managed with Fabric data factory. Incremental load implemented. Medallion architechture.
